# Web Scraping and Classification
This is a two part project. 

The first part involves using python's BeautifulSoup to extract information about the properties on sale in the Borough of Greenwich. 

The second part involves cleaning the data obtained from web scraping and using it for a classification problem; Given the price, no. of bedrooms and no.
of bathrooms, can we correctly categorise the property into "House" or "Apartment"? We finish off by deploying the model trained with the Greenwich dataset and applying it to properties in Bexley.
